For years I've read that mocks were a sign of code smell. The first time I read that, as 
a non-native english speaker, I didn't even know what mock meant or how they were used in tests.

So today, I had a practical experience where I was using mocks to test a specific feature,
but after I did some refactoring, I was able to test the code without.

Alright, straight to the code. I have a delivery app, where users can place orders from restaurants to a specific address.
