Switching from gsap to anime.js

Today I'm rewriting my animations using gsap with anime.js. The reasons for switching are as follows:

 - anime.js has a much smaller footprint in my bundle size. 80%-
 - anime.js is open source and more community oriented(github, stack overflow).
   Although the folks from greensok are active on their own forum, I'm much more comfortable with searaching for answers on stackoverflow, github, etc.
   For some reason, loading their forum site can be incredibly slow
 - Free morphing, and motion path feature.
   Although gsap's morphing plugin seems to be the best available because it can try to morph even shapes that have a different number of points, I'm currently unable to 100USD/year for I library to be used in my personal website.
   Also, I can afford to spend more time, trying to make sure that different shape paths have the same number of points.
